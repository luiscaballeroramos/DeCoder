Standard EN 1993, Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures, has been prepared by Technical Committee CEN/TC250 « Structural Eurocodes », the Secretariat of which is held by BSl. CEN/TC250 is responsible for all Structural Eurocodes. This European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical text or by endorsement, at the latest by November 2005, and conflicting National Standards shall be withdrawn at latest by .March 20 lO. This Eurocode ,\"\"0,.\"\",11.\",,, ENV 1993-1-1. According to the CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations, the National Standard Organizations of the following countries are bound to implement these European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, \\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Background to the Eurocode programme In 1 the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme in the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of technical obstacles to trade and the harmonization of technical specifications. \\\\Vithin this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonized technical rules for the design of construction works which, in a first would serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the COlmnission, with the help of a Steering Committee with Representatives of Member States, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s. In 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA on the basis of an agreement] between the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to CEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council\\'s Directives and/or Conunission\\'s Decisions dealing with European standards the Council Directive 8911 06/EEC on construction products -CPD and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/S0/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and equivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of up the internal market). The Structural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of Parts: EN 1990 Eurocode 0; Basis of Structural Design EN ]99] Eurocode 1: Actions on structures EN 1992 Eurocode 2: of concrete structures EN 1993 Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures EN 1994 Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures EN 1995 Eurocode 5: Design of timber structures EN 1996 Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures EN 1997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical EN 1998 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance EN 1999 Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures 1 Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) concerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (BC/CEN/03/89). 5 ', 7: \"BS EN 1993-1-8:2005 EN 1993-1-8:2005 (E) Eurocode standards the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have safeguarded their \\nright to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these continue to vary from State to State. Status and field of appJication of eurocodes The Member States of the EU and EFTA recognize that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the following purposes: as a means to prove compliance of building and civ'il engineering works with the essential requirements of Council Directive 89/] 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N°l -Mechanical resistance and stability and Essential Requirement N°2 Safety in case of fire; as a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related services; -as a framework for drawing up harmonized technicu} specifications for construction products (ENs and The Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the Interpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature from harmonized product standards3. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the \\nEurocodes work need to be adequately considered by CEN Technical Committees andlor EOTA Working Groups working on product standards with a view to achieving full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. The Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole structures and component products of both a traditional and un innovative nature. Unusual forms of construction or design conditions are not specifically covered and additional consideration will be required by the designer in such cases. National Standards inlplenlenting Eurocodes The National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any annexes), as published by CEN, which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and may be followed by a National annex. The National annex may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in the Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. : values andlor classes where alternatives are in the Eurocode, values to be used where a symbol only is in the Eurocode, country specific data (geographical, climatic, etc.), e.g. snow map, the procedure to be used where alternative procedures are in the Eurocode. It may contain decisions on the application of informati ve annexes, references to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode.

An exception to this design method is given in 3.9.3. 2.5 Design assumptions (l)P Joints shall be designed on the basis of a realistic assumption of the distribution of internal forces and moments. The following assumptions shall be used to determine the distribution of forces: (a) the internal forces and moments assumed in the analysis are in equilibrium with the forces and moments applied to the joints, (b) each element in the joint is capable of resisting the internal forces and moments, (c) the deformations implied by this distribution do not exceed the deformation capacity of the fasteners or welds and the connected parts, (d) the assumed distribution of internal forces shall be realistic with regard to relative stilTnesses within the joint, (e) the deformations assumed in any design model based on elastic-plastic analysis are based on rigid body rotations and/or in-plane defonnations which are physically possible, and ([) any model used is in compliance with the evaluation of test results EN 1990).@il (2) The application rules given in this part satisfy 2.S( 1). 2.6 Joints loaded in shear subject to impact, vibration and/or load reversal (l) \\\\Vhere a joint loaded in shear is subject to impact or significant vibration one of the following jointing methods should be used: welding bolts with locking devices preloaded bolts injection bolts other types ofbol1 which effectively prevent movement of the connected parts rivets. (2) Where slip is not acceptable in a joint (because it is subject to reversal of shear load or for any other reason), preloaded bolts in a Category B or C connection (see 3.4), fit bolts (see 3.6.]), rivets or welding should be used. (3) For wind and/or stability bracings, bolts in Category A connections (see 3.4) may be used. 2.7 Eccentricity at intersections (1) \\\\Vhere there is eccentricity at intersections, the joints and members should be designed for the resulting moments and forces, except in the case of particular types of structures where it has been demonstrated that it is not necessary, see 5.] .5. (2) In the case of joints of angles or tees attached by either a single line of bolts or two lines of boJts any possible eccentricity should be taken into account in accordance with 2.7(1). In-plane and out-of-plane eccentricities should be detel1uined by considering the relative positions of the centroidal axis of the member and of the setting out line in the p1ane of the connection (see Figure 2.1). For a single angle in tension connected by bolts on one the simplified design method given in 3.10.3 may be used.

This maybe taken as the overall length of the weld reduced by twice the effective throat thickness a. Provided that the weJd is full size throughout its length including starts and terminations, no reduction in effective length need be made for either the start or the termination of the weld.

(2) The design throat area should be taken as = La (3) The location of the design throat area should be assumed to be concentrated in the root. (4) A uniform distribution of stress is assumed on the throat section of the weld, leading to the normal stresses and shear stresses shown in Figure 4.5, as follows: (T..L is the normal stress perpendicular to the throat (TIl is the normal stress parallel to the axis of the weld T..L is the shear stress (in the plane of the throat) perpendicular to the axis of the weld Til is the shear stress (in the plane of the throat) parallel to the axis of the weld.

The throat thickness of a partial penetration butt weld should not be greater than the depth of penetration that can be consistently achieved, see 4.5.2(3). 4.7.3 T-buttjoints (1) The design resistance of a T-butt joint, consisting of a pair of partial penetration butt welds reinforced by superimposed fillet welds, may be dete1111ined as for a fu]] penetration butt weld (see 4.7.1) if the total nominal throat thickness, exclusive of the unwelded gap, is not less than the thickness t of the part forming the stem of the tee joint, provided that the unwe1ded gap is not more than (t I 5) or 3 mm, whichever is see Figure 4.6 @lI.

(2) It is acceptable to assume a simplified load distribution within the welds. (3) Residual stresses and stresses not subjected to transfer of load need not be included when checking the resistance of a weld. This applies specifically to the normal stress parallel to the axis of a weld. (4) Welded joints should be designed to have adequate deformation capacity ....... nUfP\\\\1PT ductility of the welds should not be relied upon.

(2) To identify whether the effects of joint behaviour on the analysis need be taken into account, a distinction may be made between three simplified joint models as follows: simple, in which the joint may be assumed not to transmit bending moments; continuous, in which the behaviour of the joint may be assumed to have no effect on the analysis; semi-continuous, in which the behaviour of the joint needs to be taken into account in the analysis. (3) The appropriate type of joint model should be determined from Table 5.1, depending on the classification orthe joint and on the chosen method of analysis. (4) The moment-rotation characteristic of a joint used in the analysis may be simplified by adopting any appropriate curve, including a linearized approximation (e.g. bi-linear or tri-linear), provided that the approximate curve lies wholly below the moment-rotation characteristic.

NOTE: The National Annex may additional information on the classification of joints by their stiffness and strength to that in 5.2.2.1 (2). 5.2.2 Classification by stiffness 5.2.2.1 General (I) A joint may be classified as rigid, nominally by comparing its initial rotational stiffness \\nor semi-rigid according to its rotational stiffness, with the classification boundaries in 5.2.2.5. NOTE: Rules for the determination of Sj,ini for joints connecting H or 1 sections are given in 6.3.1. Rules for the determination of for joints connecting hollow sections are not given in this Standard. A joint may be classified on the basis of experimental evidence, AV\\'\"Al\"·\\'Ar ...... \\'\\'\\' of previous satisfactory performance in similar cases or by calculations based on test evidence. 5.2.2.2 Nominally pinned joints (I) A nominally pinned joint should be capable of transmitting the internal forces, without significant moments which might adversely affect the members or the structure as a whole.

(l) Joints classi fled as rigid may be assumed to have sufficient rotational stiffness to justify analysis based on full continuity. 5.2.2.4 Semi-rigid joints (l) A joint which does not meet the criteria for a rigid joint or a nominally pinned joint should be classi fled as a semi-rigid joint. NOTE: joints provide a predictable of interaction bet\\\\veen members, based on the design moment-rotation characteristics of the joints. (2) Semi-rigid joints should be capable of transmitting the internal forces and moments. 5.2.2.5 Classification boundaries (1) Classification boundaries for joints other than column bases are in 5.2.2.l(1) and Figure 5.4. 54 ', 56: \"Key: Kb is Kc is Ib is Ie is Lb is Lc is Zone 1: rigid, if where: BS EN 1993-1-8:2005 EN 1993-1-8:2005 (E) kb 8 for frames where the bracing system reduces the horizontal displacement by at least 80 % kb 25 for other frames, provided \\nthat in every storey KblKc 2:: 0,1 *) Zone 2: semi-rigid All joints in zone 2 should \\nbe classified as semi-rigid.

(5.2d) (l) A joint may be classified as full-strength, nominally pinned or partial strength by comparing its design moment resistance with the design moment resistances of the members that it connects. When classifying joints, the design resistance of a member should be taken as that member adjacent to the joint. 5.2.3.2 Nominally pinned joints (l) A nominally pinned joint should be capable of transmitting the internal forces, without developing significant moments which adversely affect the members or the structure as a whole. 55 \", 57: 'BS EN 1993-1-8:2005 EN 1993-1-8:2005 (E) (2) A nominally pinned joint should be capable of accepting the resulting rotations under the design loads.

(2) Joint configurations should be designed to resist the internal bending moments Mbl,Ed and Mb2,lcd, normal forces Nbl,J::d and Nb2.J::d and shear forces Vb1.Ed and Vb2,Ed applied to the joints by the connected members, see Figure 5.6. (3) The resulting shear force Vwp,Ed in the web panel should be obtained using: Vwp.bl = (Alibl,Ed -A1b2,Ed)/z -(Vel,Ed -V\\ne2,Ed)/2 ... (5.3) where: z is Llle lever aTln, see 6.2.7. (4) To model a joint in a \\\\vay that closely reproduces the expected behaviour, the \\\\veb panel in shear and each of the connections should be modelled separately, taking account of the internal moments and forces in the members, acting at the periphery of the web panel, see figure 5.6(a) and figure 5.7. (5) As a simplified alternative to 5.3(4), a single-sided joint configuration may be modelled as a single joint, and a double-sided joint configuration may be modelled as two separate but inter-acting joints, one on each side. As a consequence a double-sided beam-to-colunm joint configuration has two moment-rotation characteristics, one for the right-hand joint and another for the left-hand joint. 56 ', 58: \"BS EN 1993-1-8:2005 EN 1993-1-8:2005 (E) (6) In a double-sided, beam-to-column joint each joint should be modelled as a separate rotational spring, as shown in Figure 5.8, in which each spring has a moment-rotation characteristic that takes into account the behaviour of the web pane] in shear as well as the influence of the relevant connections. (7) When determining the design moment resistance and rotational stiffness for each of the joints, the possible influence of the web panel in shear should be taken into account by means of the transformation parameters fJI and fJ2 , where: fJl IS the value of the transformation parameter fJ for the right-hand side joint; fJ2 is the value of the transformation parameter fJ for the left-hand side joint. NOTE: The transformation parameters /31 and fJ2 are used directly in 6.2.7.2(7) and 6.3.2(1). They are also used in 6.2.6.2(1) and 6.2.6.3(4) in connection with Table 6.3 to obtain the reduction factor \\n0) for shear. (8) Approximate values for fJl and fJ2 based on the values of the bealll moments Mbl,Ed and Mb2.I:cI at the periphery of the web panel, see Figure 5.6(a), may be obtained from Table 5.4.

To apply these methods, a joint should be modelled as an assembly of basic components, see 1.4(1 ). (2) The basic components used in this Standard are identified in Table 6.1 and their properties should be determined in accordance with the provisions given in this Standard. Other basic components may be used provided their properties are based on tests or analytical and numerical methods supported by tests, see EN 1990. NOTE: The design methods for basic joint components given in this Standard are of general application and can also be applied to similar components in other joint configurations. However the specific design methods given for determining the design moment resistance, rotational stiffness and rotation capacity of a joint are based on an assumed distribution of internal forces for joint configurations indicated in Figure 1.2. For other joint configurations, design methods for determining the design moment resistance, rotational stiffness and rotation capacity should be based on appropriate assumptions for the distribution of internal forces. 6.1.2 Structural properties 6.1.2.1 Design moment-rotation characteristic (1) A joint may be represented by a rotational spring c0Ill1ecting the centre lines of the connected members at the point of intersection, as indicated in Figure 6.l(a) and (b) for a single-sided column joint configuration. The properties of the spring can be expressed in the form of a design moment-rotation characteristic that describes the relationship between the bending moment iVfj.J::d applied to a joint and the corresponding rotation <PJ::d between the connected members. Generally the design moment-rotation characteristic is non-linear as indicated in Figure 6.1 ( c). (2) A design moment-rotation characteristic, see Figure 6.1(c) should define the following three main structural properties: moment resistance; rotational stiifness; rotation capacity. NOTE: In certain cases the actual moment-rotation behaviour of a joint includes some rotation due to such effects as bolt slip, lack of fit and, in the case of column bases, foundation-soil interactions. This can result in a significant amount of initial hinge rotation that may need to be included in the design moment-rotation characteristic. (3) The design moment-rotation characteristics of a beam-to-column joint should be consistent with the assumptions made in the global analysis of the structure and with \\nthe assumptions made in the design of the members, see EN 1993-1-1. (4) The design moment-rotation characteristic for joints and column bases of 1 and H sections as obtained [rom 6.3.1(4) may be assumed to satisfy the requirements of5.1.1(4) for simplifying this characteristic for global analysis purposes. 60 ', 62: \"6.1.2.2 Design ,Moment resistance BS EN 1993-1-8:2005 EN 1993-1-8:2005 (E) (1) The design moment resistance which is equal to the maximum moment of the design moment-rotation characteristic, see Figure 6. 1 (c), should be taken as that given by 6.1.3(4) 6.1.2.3 Rotational stiffness (l) The rotational stiffness Sj, which is the secant stiffness as indicated in Figure 6. should be taken as that given by 6.3.1 (4). For a design moment-rotation \\ncharacteristic this definition of Si applies up to the rotation at which first reaches but not for larger rotations, see Figure 6.1 (c). The initial rotational stiffness which is the slope of the elastic range of the design moment-rotation characteristic, should be taken as that given by 6.1.3(4). 6.1.2.4 Rotation capacity (1) The design rotation capacity <PCd of a joint, which is equal to the maximum rotation of the design moment-rotation characteristic, see Figure 6.1 (c), should be taken as that given by 6.1.3(4).

(2) The basic joint components should be those identified in Table 6.1, together with the reference 10 the application rules which should be used for the evaluation of their structural properties.

(2) The longitudinal stress in a column should be taken into account when determining the design resistance of the column web in compression, see 6.2.6.2(2). (3) The shear in a colunm web panel should be taken into account when determining the design resistance of the following basic components: colunm web in transverse compression, see 6.2.6.2; column web in transverse tension, see 6.2.6.3. 6.2.2 Shear forces (1) In welded connections, and in bolted connections with end-plates, the welds connecting the beam web should be designed to transfer the shear force from the connected beam to the joint, without any assistance from the welds connecting the beam flanges. (2) In bolted connections with end-plates, the design resistance of each bolt-row to combined shear and tension should be verified using the criterion given in Table 3.4, taking into account the total tensile force in the bolt, including any force due to prying action. NOTE: As a simplification, bolts required to resist in tension may be assumed to provide their full design resistance in tension when it can be shown that the design shear force does not exceed the sum of: a) the total design shear resistance of those bolts that are not required to resist tension and; b) (0,411,4) times the total design shear resistance of those bolts that are also required to resist tension. (3) In bolted connections with angle flange cleats, the cleat connecting the compression flange of the beam may be assumed to transfer the shear force in the beam to the column, provided that: the gap g between the end of the beam and the face of the column does not exceed the thickness fa of the angle cleat; the force does not exceed the design shear resistance of the bolts connecting the cleat to the column; lhe web of the beam satisfies the requirement given in EN 1993-1-5, section 6. (4) The design shear resistance of a joint may be derived from the distribution of internal forces within that joint, and the design resistances of its basic components to these forces, see Table 6.1. (5) In base plates if no special elements for resisting shear are provided, such as block or bar shear con11ectors, it should be demonstrated that the design friction resistance of the base plate, see 6.2.2(6), and, in cases where the bolt holes are not oversized, the design shear resistance of the anchor bolis, see 6.2.2(7), added up is sufficient @2] to transfer the design shear force. The design bearing resistance of the block or bar shear connectors with respect to the concrete should be checked according to EN 1992.

(2) Provided that the axial force in the connected member does not exceed 5% of the design resistance NpLRcl of its cross-section, the design moment resistance of a beam-to column joint or beam splice may be determined using the method given in 6.2.7. (3) The design moment resistance iVlj,Rd of a column base may be determined using the method given in 6.2.8. In alJ joints, the sizes of the welds should be such that the moment resistance of the joint }\\\\/1j,Rd is always limited by the design resistance of its other basic components, and not by the design resistance of the welds. (5) In a beam-to-colunm joint or beam splice in which a plastic hinge is required to form and rotate under any relevant load case, the welds should be designed to resist the effects of a moment at least equal to the smaller of: 66 the design plastic moment resistance of the connected member a times the design moment resistance of the joint where: U = 1,4 -for frames in which the bracing system satisfies the criterion (5.1) in EN ] 993-1-1 clause 5.2.1(3) with respect to sway; a = 1,7 -for all other cases. \", 68: \"BS EN 1993-1-8:2005 EN 1993-1-8:2005 (E) (6) In a bolted connection with more than one bolt-row in tension, as a simpJification the contribution of any bolt-row may be neglected, provided that the contributions of all other bolt-rows closer to the centre of compression are also neglected. 6.2.4 Equivalent T -stub in tension 6.2.4.1 General (1) In bo1ted connections an equivalent T-stub in tension may be used to model the \\nresistance of the following basic components: column flange in bending; end-plate in bending; l1ange cleat in bending; base plate in bending under tension. (2) Methods for modelling these basic components as equivalent T-stub flanges, including the values to be used for emin, and In, are given in 6.2.6. (3) The possible modes of failure of the flange of an equivalent T-stub may be assumed to be similar to those expected to occur in the basic component that it represents. (4) The total effective length of an equivalent T-stub, see 6.2, should be such that the resistance of its flange is equivalent to that of the basic joint component that it represents. NOTE: The effective length of an equivalent T-stub is a notional length and does not necessarily correspond to the physical length of the basic joint component that 11 represents. (5) The design tension resistance of aT-stub il.ange should be determined from Table 6.2. NOTE: Prying effects are implicitly taken into account when determining the design tension resistance according to Table 6.2. (6) In cases where prying forces may develop, see Table 6.2, the design tension resistance of aT-stub Dange should be taken as the smal1est value for the three possible failure modes 1, 2 and 3. In cases where prying forces may not develop the design tension resistance of a T-stub flange ,Rd should be taken as the smallest value for the two possible failure modes according to Table 6.2. e ,:Ef.' eff Figure 6.2: Dimensions of an equivalent T-stub flange 67 \", 69: \"BS EN 1993-1-8:2005 EN 1993-1-8:2005 (E) Table 6.2: Design Resistance Fr,Rd of a T-stub flange Prying forces may develop, i.e. Lb:::; Lb Mode] without backing plates with backing plates Mode2 Mode 3 Method 1 m FT.2.Rd FT,3,Rd Mode 1: Complete yielding of the Hange Method 2 (alternative method) FT,i.Rd 2ml1 ell (111 + n) Fr,I,Rd 2111n e,Jm+n) 2M pl.2,Rd + m+n M.ode 2: Bolt failure with yielding of the Hange Mode 3: Bolt failure No prying forces IJ1 Lb is -the bolt elongation length, taken equal to the grip length (total thickness of material and washers), pIlls half the sum of the height of the bolt head and the height of the nut or -the anchor bolt elongation length, taken equal 10 the sum of 8 times the nominal bolt diameter, the grout layer, the plate thickness, the washer and half the height of the nut I§)Lb (§] Ie ,{/.I 1{ Fr,Rd is the design tension resistance of a T \\n-stub flange Q IS the prying force MpLl.Rd 0,252:f efl/l I YMO J'V/pl,2,Rd = 0,252:( 0,252:f /YMO 11 1,25171 is the number of bolt rows (with 2 bolts per row) Ft,I{(1 is the design tension resistance of a bolt, see Table is the total value of for all the bolts in the T -stub; is the value of 2:::r'cff for mode 1; If.::fL2 is the value of for mode 2; emin , 111 and tr are as indicated in Figure 6.2.

When using the equivalent T-stub approach to model a group of bolt rows it may be necessary to divide the group into separate bolt-rows and use an equivalent T -stub to model each separate boh-row.
